# Library Trends Research Repository

## Overview

This repository tracks trends and innovations in LLM/Agent/AI libraries through systematic research runs. Each run focuses on discovering novel libraries that reshape core primitives: interfaces, memory, decoding, planning, observability, protocols, and packaging.

## Methodology

**Cadence:** Regular research runs documented in dated folders (DDMMYYYY format)  
**Scope:** Serious, non-meme libraries with novel primitives or paradigm shifts  
**Sources:** GitHub repositories, academic papers, standards bodies, global dev communities  
**Quality Bar:** 10/10 ideas that survive falsification attempts  

## Trend Tracker

| Trend | 02092025 | Status | Trajectory |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| Programming > Prompting | ↑↑ DSPy (27k⭐), LMQL (4k⭐) | Rising | Strong academic + community adoption |
| Memory Architectures | ↑ MemGPT/Letta ecosystem | Emerging | OS concepts gaining traction |
| Protocol Standardization | ↑ MCP emergence (2025) | New | Infrastructure-level adoption |
| Framework Interoperability | ↑ Multi-framework patterns | Rising | Vendor lock-in resistance |
| Security Gap | ↓ Only Agent-Wiz (231⭐) | Critical | Massive opportunity |
| Structured Generation | → Fragmented approaches | Stable | Engine-level gap |
