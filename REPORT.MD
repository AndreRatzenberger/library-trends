# LLM/Agent Library Research Portfolio

## Methodology & Cadence

This repository tracks novel developments in LLM/Agent/AI libraries through systematic research runs. Each run follows a structured methodology:

1. **Historical Analysis:** Review previous findings to avoid duplication
2. **Broad Sweep:** Search across GitHub, arXiv, standards bodies, global dev communities  
3. **Deep Analysis:** Cluster libraries by manipulated primitives, analyze leaders
4. **Trend Synthesis:** Extract actionable trends with evidence and counter-signals
5. **Idea Generation:** Create novel high-leverage ideas, score with weighted rubric
6. **Falsification:** Test top ideas through independent falsification attempts
7. **Quality Bar:** Only stop when â‰¥1 idea reaches 10/10 score and survives falsification

**Scoring Rubric:** Novelty (25%), Inevitability (20%), Value Unlock (20%), Feasibility (15%), Evidence (10%), Moat (10%)

**10/10 Threshold:** Overall â‰¥9.0 AND â‰¥8 in Novelty, Inevitability, Value Unlock AND survives two falsification attempts
