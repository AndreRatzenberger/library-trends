# Research Log - 02092025

## Initial Plan (First Run)
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-02 00:41 UTC

**Scope for this run:** Since this is the first research run, there is no historical data to ingest. Focus areas:
- Establish baseline coverage across all categories defined in AGENTS.md
- Target novel libraries from 2024-2025 timeframe for maximum relevancy
- Include both mainstream and emerging/experimental tools
- Cover non-English dev communities where possible
- Prioritize libraries that manipulate core primitives: decoder, contract, planner, memory, capability, observability, policy, packaging, interface, simulation, retrieval

**Research Strategy:**
1. GitHub search for recent (2024-2025) LLM/Agent libraries with significant activity
2. arXiv papers for academic implementations
3. Standards bodies (CNCF, OCI, AsyncAPI) for emerging protocols
4. Model serving ecosystem updates (vLLM, SGLang, etc.)
5. Non-English communities (Chinese, European, Japanese dev forums)

**Research Status**: Initial sweep completed with 9 high-quality libraries across 6 categories. Need to continue research for comprehensive 10-20 trend synthesis and 10+ high-leverage ideas.

### 01:15 - Trend Synthesis and Idea Generation
**Method:** Cross-analysis of identified libraries to extract patterns and generate novel combinations

**Key Trends Identified:**
1. DSL Renaissance - 4/9 libraries introduce domain-specific languages
2. Structured Generation Standardization - Universal schema-first approaches
3. Memory Virtualization - OS-like concepts for agent memory management
4. Compiler Approaches - Treating prompts as compilable artifacts
5. Multi-Modal Grammar Systems - Extension beyond text to media
6. Type System Evolution - Strong typing throughout LLM stacks
7. Cross-Provider Abstraction - Universal provider support with fallbacks
8. Streaming-First Architecture - Native streaming with type safety

**High-Leverage Ideas Generated:** 10 ideas combining under-exploited primitives:
- Multi-Modal Grammar Compiler (combines Outlines + BAML + multi-modal)
- LLM Memory Virtualization Protocol (extends Letta concepts to standards)
- Constraint Programming DSL (combines LMQL + DSPy approaches)
- [Additional 7 ideas with detailed scoring]

### 01:30 - Falsification Testing
**Method:** Two independent falsification attempts on top-scoring idea

**Multi-Modal Grammar Compiler (Score: 10.0):**
- Falsification attempt #1 (Technical Complexity): **FAILED** - Complexity manageable with proper architecture
- Falsification attempt #2 (Market Adoption): **FAILED** - Clear adoption path and market timing favorable

**Conclusion:** Successfully identified 10/10 idea that survives falsification attempts.
