# Research Log - 02092025

## Research Plan (from AGENTS.md requirements)
- Focus on serious, non-meme libraries reshaping LLM/agent primitives
- Target categories: DSLs, structured decoding, memory, interfaces, protocols, observability, simulation
- Seek 10/10 idea that survives falsification
- Build historical awareness (first run, no prior history)

## Search Strategy
1. **Broad GitHub searches** for established frameworks (DSPy, AutoGen, LangGraph)
2. **Specific library searches** for known innovations (LMQL, Instructor, Outlines)
3. **Emerging protocol searches** (MCP, Model Context Protocol)
4. **Cross-cutting theme searches** (memory, observability, structured generation)

## Key Decisions & Pivots

### Decision 1: Focus on Infrastructure vs Applications
- **Reasoning:** Infrastructure changes have higher leverage than applications
- **Evidence:** DSPy, LMQL, MCP show infrastructure-level innovation
- **Action:** Prioritize primitives that reshape programming models

### Decision 2: Weight Recent Emergence Heavily  
- **Reasoning:** MCP ecosystem (2025) shows early adoption of important standards
- **Evidence:** Infrastructure-level integrations despite low star counts
- **Action:** Factor in velocity and infrastructure adoption over pure star counts

### Decision 3: Identify Cross-Category Opportunities
- **Reasoning:** Highest leverage at intersections of underserved needs
- **Evidence:** MCP + Memory, Security + Framework design gaps
- **Action:** Generate ideas combining multiple underserved primitives

## Negative Findings (Important Counter-signals)

### 1. Educational Content Proliferation
- **Observation:** Many LangGraph tutorials, AutoGen guides
- **Implication:** High learning curves, complex tooling
- **Impact:** Adoption barriers exist despite technical merit

### 2. Fragmented Tooling
- **Observation:** Multiple competing solutions in same space
- **Implication:** Market not consolidated, standards emerging
- **Impact:** Standardization opportunities but also selection risk

### 3. Low Adoption Despite Technical Merit
- **Observation:** Advanced libraries (LMQL) have lower adoption than expected
- **Implication:** Technical complexity vs. developer experience tension
- **Impact:** UX and DX critical for infrastructure adoption

### 4. Very Recent Emergence
- **Observation:** Many key libraries from 2024-2025
- **Implication:** Ecosystem still forming, high volatility
- **Impact:** Ideas need to account for rapid evolution

## Research Quality Checks

### Global Coverage
- **US/EU:** Dominated by US (GitHub, OpenAI ecosystem)
- **Asia:** Limited Chinese/Japanese libraries found
- **Bias:** English-language bias, GitHub-centric

### Academic vs Industry
- **Academic:** ETH-SRI (LMQL), Stanford (DSPy)
- **Industry:** Microsoft (AutoGen), Anthropic (MCP)
- **Balance:** Good mix of academic rigor + industry adoption

### Timeframe Coverage
- **2024-2025:** Most innovative work
- **2023:** Foundation libraries
- **Earlier:** Mostly legacy at this point

## Ideas Generation Process

### 1. Gap Analysis
- Identified underserved primitives: security, observability, engine-level decoding
- Cross-referenced with evidence of demand
- Prioritized infrastructure over applications

### 2. Intersection Exploration
- Combined memory (MemGPT) + protocols (MCP)
- Security-first + framework design
- Engine optimization + structured generation

### 3. Falsification Preparation
