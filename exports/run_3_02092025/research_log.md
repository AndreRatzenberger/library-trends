- [2025-09-02T11:48:34.629085] Kickoff (FUN): weird-first scouting. Using prior DB (12 repos) + topic_graph_20250902.json to seed adjacencies; languages=Python,TypeScript,Rust; focus areas: grammar-guided decoding, agent societies, browser-native agents, embedded DSLs, schema-first reasoning.
- [2025-09-02T11:49:06.062105] Observation: DB has 12 prior repos (guidance, graphlang, AgentSociety, browser-use, WorkArena...). Topic graph low-degree seeds: earley, constrained, parsing, miniwob, syntax. Inference: gaps in grammar-guided decoding (Earley/PEG/GLR), graph DSLs, and browser micro-tasks. Decision: seed frontier with ['earley parser','constrained decoding','graphlang','miniwob'] across Python/TS/Rust. Outcome: proceed to frontier sweep (max_new=3).
- [2025-09-02T11:49:12.098036] Because TF-IDF/high-interest term 'earley parser' yielded https://github.com/lark-parser/lark (lang=Python, stars=5489), persisted it and will explore adjacent terms from its README next.
- [2025-09-02T11:49:12.704503] Because TF-IDF/high-interest term 'earley parser' yielded https://github.com/mideind/GreynirServer (lang=Python, stars=66), persisted it and will explore adjacent terms from its README next.
- [2025-09-02T11:49:13.322346] Because TF-IDF/high-interest term 'earley parser' yielded https://github.com/klauer/blark (lang=Python, stars=52), persisted it and will explore adjacent terms from its README next.
- [2025-09-02T11:49:51.987804] Triage: Clusters show parsing-heavy group (cluster 0: lark) and language/DSL services (cluster 1: GreynirServer, blark). Inferred primitives: (1) Grammar-guided decoding runtime (Earley/GLR/PEG), (2) Serverized grammar endpoints for agents, (3) Token-level constraint injection. Decision: Deep-dive grammar-guided decoding for agent action spaces; capture strengths/limits/missing pieces.
- [2025-09-02T11:50:22.262553] Outcome: Seed idea scored â€” DGO (Dynamic Grammar Overlays) weighted=8.29 (novelty=9.2, weirdness=8.5, zeitgeist=8.3). Next: falsify via (a) runtime overhead on decoder hooks, (b) prior art duplication in constrained decoding libraries.
